This projects is as a demonstration of my current abilities with HTML web scraping, as well as data management with sqlite and pandas' DataFrames.

The purpose of the project is to obtain all the data regarding subjects from a master and what professors are involved.

Apart from this, as a side project, I have also extracted the contact info of each professor, given that this was part of the page code.
